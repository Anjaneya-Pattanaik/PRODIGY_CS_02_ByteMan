# PRODIGY_CS_02_ByteMan
Welcome to the Image Encryption Using Byte Manipulation project repository! This Python program allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using byte manipulation, providing a simple yet effective way to secure your images.

Introduction:
Image encryption is an important aspect of cybersecurity, especially when it comes to protecting sensitive visual information. This program implements image encryption using byte manipulation, ensuring that the encrypted images can only be decrypted with the correct key or password.

Features:
Encrypt images using byte manipulation.
Decrypt encrypted images with the correct key or password.
Menu-based interface for ease of use.
Recursive design for seamless navigation.
Handles both single-key and multiple-key encryption for added security.
Provides flexibility with user input for image path and encryption key.

Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed.
Run the image_encryption.py file.
Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt images.
